Question 1: Who visits the most? 
Answer: Michael N Herzog visits the white house the most with 108 visits. After doing research I found that he's Israel's Ambassador to the U.S.

  group_by(full_name_visitor) |>
  summarize(
    total_visits=n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_visits))

```

Question 2: Who gets the most visitors?
Answer: When you take away staff that would generally deal with the public the top five White House officials in order of number of visits received are: VPOTUS(4306 visits)  this is Kamala Harris
FLOTUS (1905 visits) this is First Lady, Jill Biden
Tarun Chhabra (1853 visits) Tarun served on the White House National Security Council staff as Director for Strategic Planning and Director for Human Rights and National Security Issues, according to his bio at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.
Claudia Marconi (1657 visit) Claudia Marconi is White House Senior Advisor for Congressional Engagement. She  in charge of all the logistical details of Members of Congress’ engagement for events and meetings at the White House, and travel with the President and First Lady.
John Finer (1432  visits) – Finer is the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor at the White House. He previously served as Chief of Staff and Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State, according to his bio on

Question 3: How frequently does the president get visitors? Robert, which % of all visits are the POTUS.
Answer: Roughly 8.9% of visitors to the white house log that they are visiting the POTUS.

Question 5: how frequently does house or senate leadership visit the WH? A better question is what percentage of the logged visits are from leaders of the house or senate. 

Senate: 
D- Patty Murray, Chuck Shumer, Dick Durbin, Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner 
R- Mitch McConnell, John Thune, John Barrasso, Ernst Joni, Shelley Moore Capito, Steve Daines

House: 
D- Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, Pete Aguilar, James Clyburn 
R- Mike Johnson, Steve Svalise, Tom Emmer, Elise Stenfanik, Gary Palmer

Story Ideas:

The Israel Ambassador visited more than anyon else Michael N Herzog. We should investigate when he visited, too see if it was primarly after 10/7. We could write a story about increased communication with the embassy following the increased violence in the middle east, and because of the conflict, it would be newsworthy to evaluate Herzog and explain his role.   

When does the minority come to visit? Mcconnel, Stefanik, Emmer and Palmer did not visit the white house at all, and Scalise visited only once. Collabortation with the White House is a central part of leadership jobs, even the minority's job (technically.) IWe would run this for other administration's data and compare how often minority members visited differing administrations. We would also contact each member's comms team and hear what their explation is. 

Office hours for a normal job are commonly referred to as a “nine-to-five" operation. But running the county means working all hours. Still, for the White House to take a meeting late into the night the visit may signify notable importance. In our analysis of White House visitor logs between January 2022 and June 2023 we uncovered 933 meetings taking place between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. Who are the most frequent visitors skulking through the White House during the dead of night and what could be so important it can’t wait until the morning? This story will examine the nightly activities of the Biden White House. To make the story better, we would need journalistic access to the people coming and going from the building.
